## 🛠 Skills
⚡️Programming language: C, Embedded C, Boot loader.

⚡️AVR Microcontroller Architecture. Memory types.

⚡️AVR MCU Peripherals (ADC, Timer, EEPROM, Watchdog timer, DIO).

⚡️Good understanding of static Design (Layard Architecture and Modules inside it).

⚡️Communication Protocols (UART, SPI, I2C).


## Some Lessons Learned

● Modular program and static design.

● Memory Mapped Registers.

● Software Architecture.

● Reentrant, Non-Reentrant Function.

● Timers Hardware & modes.
